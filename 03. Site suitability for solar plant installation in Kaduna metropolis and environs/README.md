# Summary of Project
- This project employed a multi criteria decision making process to determine the ideal locations within the selected area of interest for the siting of solar proojects. This project used topographic, climatic and infrastructural datasets to produce a final suitability map. Each dataset was prepared for suitable use, reclassified and used as inputs for a weighted overlay process on ArcGIS. The weights for each layer was determined using Analytic heirarchical process (AHP).
