# Summary of Project
- This project was executed to determine the level of pollutant concentration at different times of the day and at different locations within the study area. 3 different pollutants were considered and readings were taking at different points. The readings taken were used to produce a pollution map through the use of interpolation techniques on ArcGIS. The pollutant readings were also used to determine the air quality index which as also mappped out and analysed.
