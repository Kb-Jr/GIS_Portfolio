# Summary of Project
- The effect of urban growth of Karu due to its proximity with the FCT was assessed. A spatio-temporal analysis over a 30 year period was used to monitor urban growth and the variations in vegetation vigor. Satellite imageries were used to achieve this by the utilization of supervised image classifications and Normalised  Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) computation. Subsequently the landuse landcover statistics were derived and used to provide discussions.


## Tools deployed
- ArcGIS
- MS Excel
